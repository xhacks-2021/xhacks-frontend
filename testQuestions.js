  "text": "Since web technology and design trends affect how the public uses the internet, web applications require structural and aesthetic changes to stay appealing to users over a long time. This necessitates web developers to maintain an application’s code, which becomes costly over time. Therefore, development teams should invest in maximizing a developer’s efficiency at maintaining code. By improving code legibility, developers increase their efficiency at navigating codebases. This task is accomplishable through using comments (notes left by programmers) or using an effective design pattern like the Model-View-Controller architecture. Comments are flexible because they can be used in a variety of ways but are easy to misuse. Design patterns provide an overall model of a codebase for developers, helping them navigate the project’s code. The choice of web technologies is also important when designing a web application since it determines developer limitations (and thus the speed at which they write code). By reducing the number of bugs (coding errors) that enter a project’s codebase, developers decrease the code maintenance scope. Teams can use employ pair programming or increase their focus on code reviews to minimize bugs. Compared to solo programming, pair programming generally results in fewer developer mistakes, thus reducing the number of bugs in the product. To better detect bugs before they enter the codebase, teams can add more developers to the code review process; however, its effectiveness grows slower as its usage increases. These techniques help with increasing code maintenance efficiency, but they must be carefully balanced; their overuse have the opposite effect. The way the public interacts with the internet evolves over time, which is a phenomenon caused by changes in web technology and changes in design trends. An example of the former is Microsoft’s (2021) discontinued support for their Microsoft Edge Legacy web browser, while the latter can be observed in the general changes in web design philosophies from an emphasis on animations (Lunenfeld, 2006) to design frameworks that prioritize reader-friendliness (Biskjaer et al., 2019). Due to the internet’s everchanging landscape, developing a long-lasting and appealing web application requires structural and aesthetic changes over time; in particular, web developers need to regularly maintain an application’s code. Since software maintenance is expensive – estimated at around 50-80% of the total cost associated with an application’s lifecycle (April et al., 2000) – it is in a business’s best interest to maximize the efficiency of the software maintenance process, specifically code maintenance for developers. This report aims to help web developers (and their development teams) increase their productivity by exploring the following techniques they can employ to improve their code maintenance efficiency: ● Improving code legibility using (1) comments; and (2) architectural design. ● Choosing the best technology stack for a project. ● Reducing the frequency and impact of programmer-induced mistakes by (1) employing peer programming; and (2) increasing the scope of code reviews. Particularly, this report will consider the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches, including the drawbacks from their overuse. The Code Maintenance Process Consider a typical maintenance cycle for a development team using the Agile project management philosophy. From a developer’s point of view, such a team would roughly follow the following process: 1. The team identifies an issue to address and assigns a developer to said issue. 2. The developer identifies areas of the code to update. 3. The developer makes changes to the code in the identified areas. 4. The code is reviewed and tested to ensure it addresses the identified issue. From this perspective, there are two paths towards increasing the efficiency of code maintenance: (1) shorten the time it takes to complete a code maintenance cycle; and (2) decrease the number of maintenance cycles needed. For developers to efficiently identify what code to update, development teams need to minimize the time it takes for developers to identify the functions of each section of code. At many companies, multiple web developers work on the same project. For example, at Tjene Consulting Corp, there are always at least three developers working on Kurve, a data visualization tool. Combined with employees frequently entering and leaving projects, many Tjene developers first interact with a given piece of code during code maintenance. With easy-to-understand code, developers require less effort to familiarize themselves with how the code works, thus improving their speed in this area."
